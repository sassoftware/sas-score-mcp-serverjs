  ## find-job — locate a specific SAS Viya job

  LLM Invocation Guidance
  Use THIS tool when the user intent is to check if ONE job exists or retrieve its metadata:
  - "find job cars_job_v4"
  - "does job sales_summary exist"
  - "is there a job named churnScorer"
  - "lookup job forecast_monthly"
  - "verify job ETL_Daily" 

  Do NOT use this tool when the user asks for:
  - A list or browse of many jobs (use listJobs)
  - Do not use this tool if the user want to find lib, find table, find model and similar requests
  - Executing a job (use job)
  - Running a job definition (use jobdef)
  - Submitting arbitrary code (use program)

  Purpose
  Quickly determine whether a named job asset is present in the Viya environment and return its entry (or an empty result if not found).

  Parameters
  - name (string, required): Exact job name (case preserved). If multiple tokens/names supplied, take the first and ignore the rest; optionally ask for a single name.

  Behavior & Matching
  - Attempt exact match first (backend determines sensitivity).
  - Returns { jobs: [...] } where array length is 0 (not found) or 1+ (if backend returns multiple with the same display name).
  - No fuzzy guesses—never fabricate a job.
  - If no name provided: ask "Which job name would you like to find?".

  Response Contract
  - Always: { jobs: Array<string|object> }
  - On error: propagate structured server error (do not wrap in prose when invoked programmatically).

  Disambiguation Rules
  - Input only "find job" → ask for missing name.
  - Input contains verbs like "run" or "execute" → use run-job or run-jobdef instead.
  - Input requesting many (e.g., "find all jobs") → use list-jobs.

  Examples (→ mapped params)
  - "find job cars_job_v4" → { name: "cars_job_v4" }
  - "does job ETL exist" → { name: "ETL" }
  - "is there a job named metricsRefresh" → { name: "metricsRefresh" }

  Negative Examples (should NOT call find-job)
  - "list jobs" (list-jobs)
  - "run job cars_job_v4" (run-job)
  - "execute jobdef cars_job_v4" (run-jobdef)

  Clarifying Question Template
  - Missing name: "Which job name would you like to find?"
  - Multiple names: "Please provide just one job name (e.g. 'cars_job_v4')."

  Notes
  - For bulk existence checks loop over names and call find-job per name.
  - Combine with run-job tool if user wants to execute after confirming existence.
